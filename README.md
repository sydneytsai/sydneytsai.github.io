The three components of the website that I have personalized include the skills section, where I added a languages subheader. This allows me to add other subheaders, such as platforms and databases once I have gained the experience. I have also added a soft skills section, which highlights skills outside of my technical background. I also added a list under this portion of the website to list the skills.
